**<h1>Hi, i'm Aldar - C++ enjoyer (Junior) :earth_americas:</h1>**
Started my career in the programming industry with python and has so far stopped at C++.<br>
No matter how strong a boost to the study of any spectrum of science a university would be, in my opinion, self-study and self-discipline are better.<br>However, I feel the same way about courses as I do about the university (~~this does not mean that I am against it;~~ it's just that you get more knowledge by studying on your own).<br>That's why I prefer articles/podcasts and literature more, for example:<br>
- [x] А.В.Столяров - Азы программирование [1 издание];
- [x] А.В.Столяров - Системы и сети [2 издание];
- [x] А.В.Столяров - Парадигмы [3 издание];
- [x] А.В.Столяров - Введение в язык Си++;
- [x] Скотт Майерс - Эффективное использование Си++;
- [ ] Бьерн Страуструп - Программирование;
- [ ] Бьерн Страуструп - Краткий курс. Второе издание.

So far, I've been doing an internship at **IT-Kalmykia**, but since their bias is more in web development, I'm now floating freely :hourglass:
