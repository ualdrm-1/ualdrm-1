**<h1>Hi, i'm Aldar - C++ enjoyer (Junior) :earth_americas:</h1>**
Started my career in the programming industry with python and has so far stopped at C++.<br>
No matter how strong a boost to the study of any spectrum of science a university would be, in my opinion, self-study and self-discipline are better.<br>However, I feel the same way about courses as I do about the university (~~this does not mean that I am against it;~~ it's just that you get more knowledge by studying on your own).<br>That's why I prefer articles/podcasts and literature more, for example:<br>
- [x] А.В.Столяров - Азы программирования(Pascal) [1 издание];
- [x] А.В.Столяров - Низкоуровневое программирование(Assembler & C) [2 издание];
- [x] А.В.Столяров - Системы и сети(Operating Systems) [3 издание];
- [x] А.В.Столяров - Парадигмы(C++ & Lisp & Tcl) [4 издание];
- [x] David Thomas&Andrew Hunt - Pragmatic programmer;
- [x] Scott Meyers - 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs;
- [x] Scott Meyers - Effective Modern C++;
- [x] Jacek Golovic - C++17 STL;
- [x] Scott Chacon & Ben Straub - Pro Git 2-nd Edition;
- [ ] Max Schlee - QT 5.10;
- [ ] Thomas Cormen .. - Introduction to Alghoritms 3-d Edition;
- [ ] Scott Meyers - Effective STL.

So far, I've been doing an internship at **IT-Kalmykia**, but since their bias is more in web development, I'm now floating freely :hourglass:
